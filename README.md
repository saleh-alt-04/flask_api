## R1: Identification of the _problem_ you are trying to solve by building this particular _app_?

An e-commerce API (Application Programming Interface) can solve a wide range of problems related to online shopping, such as:

Inventory Management: An e-commerce API can help manage inventory levels by providing real-time updates on product availability, allowing businesses to avoid overselling or running out of stock.
    
 Order Management: E-commerce APIs can manage orders, including tracking orders and providing updates on the status of an order. This can help businesses to streamline their order management process and improve customer service.

## R2 :Why is it a _problem_ that needs solving?

Inventory Management: E-commerce businesses often face challenges with managing their inventory levels, as they need to balance stock levels with demand to avoid stockouts or overstocking. This can result in lost sales, reduced revenue, and poor customer experience. With an e-commerce API that provides real-time inventory updates, businesses can accurately manage their inventory levels, avoid stockouts and overstocking, and provide a positive shopping experience for their customers.
    
Order Management: Efficient order management is essential for businesses to ensure that they fulfill customer orders in a timely manner. Without an effective order management system, businesses may miss orders, delay deliveries, or send incorrect products to customers. This can result in dissatisfied customers, negative reviews, and damage to the business's reputation. With an e-commerce API that provides efficient order management, businesses can ensure that they fulfill customer orders accurately and quickly, resulting in happy customers and repeat business.

## R3 :Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?
SQLite is a lightweight, open-source, embedded relational database management system that is designed for local storage and is often used in small-scale applications such as mobile apps and desktop applications. SQLite is easy to set up and requires minimal configuration, making it a popular choice for developers who want a simple, self-contained database system. SQLite also supports SQL queries, transactions, and multiple concurrent users.

One of the main advantages of SQLite is its simplicity and ease of use. It is a self-contained, serverless database that requires no separate installation or configuration, which makes it easy to set up and use. SQLite is also highly portable and can be used across multiple platforms and operating systems.

However, one of the main drawbacks of SQLite is that it may not be suitable for large-scale applications or those with high concurrency needs, as it does not support multiple writers at the same time. Additionally, SQLite has limited support for advanced features such as stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions.

Compared to other database systems, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite has fewer features and may not be as scalable or performant for large-scale applications. However, it is a good choice for small-scale projects or applications that require a simple, self-contained database system with minimal configuration requirements.

## R4 Identify and discuss the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM

ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique that maps object-oriented programming language constructs to relational database structures. The key functionalities and benefits of an ORM are as follows:

1.  Simplified Database Interactions: ORM enables developers to work with databases using object-oriented programming constructs, such as classes and objects, instead of having to write complex SQL queries. This simplifies database interactions and reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to interact with the database.
    
2.  Database Abstraction: ORM provides a layer of abstraction between the application code and the underlying database. This allows developers to work with multiple database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, without having to learn the specific syntax and quirks of each system.
    
3.  Data Modeling: ORM allows developers to define database schemas using object-oriented programming constructs. This simplifies the process of designing and managing database schemas, as developers can use familiar
programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to model complex data structures.
    

Overall, the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM include simplified database interactions, database abstraction, data modelling, security and reliability, and performance optimization. ORM can simplify the development process, make database interactions easier, provide better data modelling, improve security, and optimise performance.
